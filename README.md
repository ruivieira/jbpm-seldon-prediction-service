# jBPM Seldon prediction service

## Description

This module contains an example implementation of a prediction service backend which connects to [Seldon](https://www.seldon.io/) model server.

The prediction service allows to set a model's predictions as the Human Task output. If the prediction's `confidence` is higher than the
`confidenceThreshold` then the Human Task is automatically completed.

 The example Human Task has three inputs (`actor`, `level`, `item`) and one output (`approved`).

To configure the service, Seldon's server URL must be specified by passing the location in the format `org.jbpm.task.prediction.service.seldon.url="<PROTOCOL>://<HOST>:<PORT>"`. This can be done either with Java properties, for instance when invoking Business Central with:

```shell
./bin/standalone.sh -Dorg.jbpm.task.prediction.service.seldon.url="http://localhost:5000"
```

Or through a `seldom.properties` file in the classpath with contents:

```properties
org.jbpm.task.prediction.service.seldon.url="http://localhost:5000"
```

Note that the Seldon URL just refers to the hostname, it does not include any endpoint.


 ## Installation

 To install the service example simply build the JAR using

 ```
$ mvn clean install
 ```

and place it in the jBPM server's classpath.

The example Human Task located in `test/resources/BPMN2-UserTask.bpmn2` can be imported into jBPM to run the example from the unit tests.

### Seldon

To try this prediction service, you will need a Seldon server.

If using OpenShift, you can install a Seldon model written to try this provided example. The model is already packaged as a Docker image (`ruivieira/jbpm-seldon-test-model`, available [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ruivieira/jbpm-seldon-test-model)) and to install it on OpenShift you simply run:

```
$ oc new-app ruivieira/jbpm-seldon-test-model
$ oc expose svc/jbpm-seldon-test-model
```

This will create.a Seldon server, with an exposed route which you should make a note of, *e.g.* http://jbpm-seldon-test-model-default.apps-crc.testing/ and provide the URL to the prediction service as specified above.

The prediction service will take care of connecting Seldon with jBPM's Human Tasks. The core functionality is available in the class `AbstractSeldonPredictionService` for which you must implement a concrete class with your particular model requirements.

An example implementation is provided as `ExampleSeldonPredictionService`. The two main methods that need to be implemented are:

* `buildPredictFeatures`
* `parsePredictFeatures`

`buildPredictFeatures` is responsible for taking the inputs of the Human Task and transforming them into "features"  a list of numerical values) which the Seldon model understands. For instance, turning `String`s into categorical labels or One-Hot encoding categories. Seldon expects a two-dimensional list of features (each element a single prediction), but the prediction service will only provide a single prediction request. As such, the return value will be a `List<List<Double>>` with a single list element.

`parsePredictFeatures` performs the reverse operation, turning Seldon's response into data which the Human Task is expecting.

In the example service, `buildPredictFeatures` transforms `ActorId` and `price` into a list of category and price, that is: `["john", 1913.2] -> [[0.0, 1913.2]]`. The prediction service will then serialise the message, query the prediction and pass the response to `parsePredictFeatures`.

The `/predict` endpoint will be hit with the following `POST` payload:

```json
{
	"data": {
		"ndarray": [[0.0, 1913.2]]
	}
}
```

And a typical response from Seldon would be something like:

```json
{
	"data": {
		"names": ["t:0", "t:1"],
		"ndarray": [[0.71,0.29]]
	},
	"meta":{}
}
```

This gets parsed by the prediction service into a `PredictionResponse` object. The feature names can be accessed using `response.getData().getNames()` and the features with `response.getData().getArray()`.

### Supported response fields

This prediction service supports the following Seldon response data types:

* `ndarray`
* `tensor`
* `tftensor`

`ndarray` response data will be available via `response.getData().getArray()`. `tensor` response data will be available via `response.getData().getTensor()` and `tftensor` will be available via `response.getData().getTfTensor()`.

Althouth `ndarray` and `tensor` responses will be automatically deserialized into Java native data structures, `tftensor` responses will be available as a `List<Byte>` and further deserialization is left to the user.

Metadata tags are also supported and, if available, can be accessed at `response.getMetadata().getTags()`.
